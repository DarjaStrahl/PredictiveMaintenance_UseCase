# Anomaly Detection: Rim Cleaning Machine Use Case

## Bachelor Thesis
[Anomaly Detection Using Time Series Analysis for Vibration Signals](https://github.com/DarjaStrahl/PredictiveMaintenance/blob/master/document.pdf) - Darja Strahlberg, Bachelor Thesis, TUHH 2020

The overall structure is composed of 3 parts: an ARIMA model for forecasting the vibration signal, Confidence Interval build in the correlation to the forecast and an evaluation of data points lying outside of the confidence interval. 

## Dependencies
```Python == 3.7, numpy, statsmodels```
## How to Run
Load the data, clicj run in the jupiter Notebook to excetute cells and show the results.
